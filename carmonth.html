            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The <b>Mitsubishi Xpander</b> is a seven-seater small MPV which was launched by Mitsubishi Motor Philippine Corporation’s (MMPC) in March 2018. Replacing the brand’s AUV, the Adventure, the Xpander slots in with its dynamic shield design and car-like chassis that promises better overall comfort with coil springs on all four wheels while riding on a good amount of ground clearance. Philippine versions of the Xpander are manufactured in Indonesia, where the model has grown in popularity, achieving several accolades.

                Equipped with a 1.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder gasoline engine with MIVEC technology, the Xpander promises good returns for fuel economy along with adequate performance. The engine comes mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission that is of the traditional variety or a 5-speed manual transmission.

            <h1>Chassis</h1>
            <p>The Xpander comes with the NC1W gasoline engine from Mitsubishi. The MPV is capable enough and it has a four-cylinder motor under the hood which means engine noise and vibration will be kept to a minimum. Mitsubishi employed a 1.5-liter DOHC gasoline engine with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve-timing Electronic Control (MIVEC). This four-cylinder can produce a total of 105 hp with 141 Nm of torque and comes mated to either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. 

                The platform of the Xpander is based on a sedan. The front suspension system is a MacPherson strut, while the rear comes with a torsion beam suspension setup. Pair this with a monocoque chassis, and the MPV can tout quiet performance with good behavior going over less-than-perfect roads. </p>

            <h1>Exterior</h1>
            <p>Mitsubishi took its dynamic shield design language and brought the concept to the Xpander. The MPV’s iteration is quite possibly one of the more outgoing in the Mitsubishi lineup; and shares several design cues with the latest versions of the Montero Sport. The front bumper not only housed the front foglamps, but also the headlights and turn signals. The DRLs can be found where one expects the headlights to be and is one of the traits that helped define this MPV. In GLS Sport variants, the Xpander can be had with extra body kits that add a chin to the front fascia. 

                The rear is more subdued than the front half. LEDs and halogens make up the lighting cluster. You may also find a rear fog light at the bottom of the rear bumper along with a diffuser that makes the car’s stance seem lower. </p>

            <h1>Interior</h1>
            <p>As an MPV that will be taking many duties on the road as a mini-people hauler, its interior is laden with durable plastics with cloth seats. Opting for the top trims will merit a leather-wrapped steering wheel and different panels as compared to GLX variants with their use of polyurethane for the steering wheel. The dashboard is laden with a faux-leather texture complete with faux stitching. 

                Cabin space is more than ample for its class. Space is adequate up to the second row, with the third row being better-reserved for children and smaller individuals. Occupants can enjoy a plethora of cubby holes and storage space options. Thanks to the flat loading bay, and a minimal loading lip, the Xpander transforms from being a family hauler to a capable cargo vehicle if need be. </p>
