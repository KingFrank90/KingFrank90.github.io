            <div class="l2 col-6"><p>You can call me Frank for your convenience. I’m from Lipa City, Batangas and I’m partially introvert but I’m working on it. I graduated a 2-year course of Information Technology in college and after half a year I got a part time as an encoder for PhilHealth then I move to Taguig, to my brother-in-law’s house because I got hired for a warehouse staff job in a Hotel and Casino in Manila but after 3years I resign to take care of my Computer rental business. Then a year after, Covid strikes and I sold my units and look for another job. I found another warehouse job for a cellphone company and stayed there for 3 years then I resigned in February 2023. After that I tried to find job online but realize I want to pursue my love for career in IT but need to refresh my memory of it and learn the technology that I missed. Making programs working and tweaking for improvement for the convenience of other people makes me wonder of many possibilities. I’m still living in my sister and brother-in-law’s house but I dream and my goal in life is to live comfortably by myself and have an income that will make me able to afford a family in the future.</p></div>
